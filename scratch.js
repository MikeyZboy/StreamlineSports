// Problems to work through

/**
 * Wednesday 10.21
 * 1. index.html should be a landing page - description, why it exists, links to nav the site
 * 2. links to each other html page should be direct from nav bar up top
 * 3. image in the middle, could be a calendar?
 * 4. sports, leagues, teams, OR events could be the last link -> send to a calendar page of events for month (need to confirm with API)
 * 5. data needs to be displayed in each of those html pages referencing respective APIs
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Thursday 10.22
 * 1. figure out the picture grid
 * 2. should i do the events page too?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 
    APIs - need to be have an additional input on end passed through via eventListeners
 *      search for team by name
 *      search for event by event name
 *      list all sports (in dropdown)
 *      list all leagues (in dropdown)
 *      "list all users loved teams and players" - filter to teams for the dropdown, could be good way.
 * 
 *  teams are identified by idTeam: "133662" six digit strings
 *  also in that object is strTeam: "Werder Bremen"
 * 
 *      livescores 
 *      live events on today...
