### Description ###

For sports fans who just want facts. 

----------------------------------------
### Getting Started ###

Via web browser:

Simply navigate to StreamlineSports.com and click get started:
 - find information on various sports around the world
 - filter your favorite sports/leagues/teams
 - know upcoming events
 - access score predictions (v2)

----------------------------------------
### User Stories ###

As a user, I should be able to land on a clean, easy to consume, navigable homepage that will allow me to learn more about sports, teams, and what sporting events are taking place.

As a user, I want options for me to:
 - see what events are taking place today
 - filter to the sport(s) I want
 - filter to the team I like to follow
 - sign up for updates on the team/sport (merch, games, transfers, news) 

As a user, I may want to sync that sport/team's future schedule with my calendar app (Google, Outlook, iCal).

As a user, I may also want to dive deeper into future score predictions to sound like I know my team or make wagers against the house (*not part of Streamline*).

As a user, I may want to connect with other like-minded fans via:
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Reddit
- Local Meetups
- Bars/Restaurants showing the events
