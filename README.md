### Description ###

For the sports fans who want sports centered around their lives, not the other way around. 
:sunglasses:

----------------------------------------
### Getting Started ###

Via web browser:

Simply navigate to StreamlineSports.com and access:
 - current/upcoming sporting events
 - filter your favorite teams/sports
 - follow *all* of their competitions
 - access score predictions

----------------------------------------
### User Stories ###

As a user, I should be able to land on a clean, easy to consume, navigable homepage that displays what is upcoming in sporting events.

As a user, I want options for me to take action:
 - see what events are taking place today
 - filter to the sport(s) I want
 - filter to the team I like to follow
 - sign up for updates on the team/sport (merch, games, transfers, news) 

As a user, I may want to sync that sport/team's future schedule with my calendar app (Google, Apple, etc.).

As a user, I may also want to dive deeper into future score predictions to sound like I know my team or make wagers against the house (*not part of Streamline*).

As a user, I may want to connect with other like-minded fans via:
- Reddit
- Facebook Groups
- Zoom
- Local Meetups
- Bars/Restaurants showing the events
